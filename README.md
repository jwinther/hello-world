Just for the introductory test

Quite interesting to learn about Git and GitHub - will probably be usefu for other kinds of activities as well, but so far I see the purpose for the R and Data Analysis courses.

I have used other similar tools, but this one was the so far simplest to get started with - no complicated installation and setup, no equally complicated creation of user accounts etc., just plain simple point and click!
